# Payment Service Controller Documentation

## Overview
The `PaymentController` class is a REST controller that handles payment processing in the payment service module. It offers an endpoint for processing payments based on the received payment details.

## Endpoints

### 1. Process Payment

**Endpoint:** `/payment/process`

**Method:** `POST`

**Request Body:**
- Payment Details in the form of `PaymentDto`.

**Response:**
- Payment status wrapped in `PaymentStatusResponseDto`.
- In case of successful payment processing, a `200 OK` status is returned along with the payment status details.
- For any exceptions or internal server errors during processing, a `500 Internal Server Error` status is returned.

## Payload Definitions

### PaymentDto
A data transfer object representing the details required for payment processing.

**Fields:**
- `orderNumber`: The unique order number for which the payment is being made.

### PaymentStatusResponseDto
A data transfer object that wraps the payment status response.

**Fields:**
(Not specified in the provided code. Would typically include fields indicating payment status, transaction ID, payment method, etc.)

## Logs
The controller logs the initiation of a payment processing request. The log format for the event is:
```
eventName=ProductController, received payment processing request for orderNumber={orderNumber}
```
Here, `{orderNumber}` would be replaced by the actual order number for which the payment request has been made.

## Dependencies
The controller relies on the `PaymentService` bean to handle the actual payment processing logic. This service is autowired into the controller.

## Note
Any exceptions that occur during payment processing are caught, and an internal server error response is returned. However, for better user experience and debugging, it might be useful to log the exception and return a more descriptive error message to the client in future implementations.
