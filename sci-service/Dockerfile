Given the provided `pom.xml` for the `sci-service`, which is described as a "service connector interface" and likely an API gateway, here's a Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
# Use the official maven/Java image to create a build artifact.
FROM maven:3.8.3-jdk-17 as builder

# Set the working directory in docker
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the pom.xml file into the working directory in docker
COPY pom.xml .

# Download project dependencies (for caching purposes)
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline -B

# Copy the rest of the files into the working directory in docker
COPY src ./src/

# Package the application
RUN mvn package

# Use the official OpenJDK 17 slim image for a runtime environment with just the JRE installed
FROM openjdk:17-slim

# Set deployment directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the jar file from the builder stage to the current directory
COPY --from=builder /app/target/sci-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar /app/sci-service.jar

# Set the command to run the application using the java command
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app/sci-service.jar"]
```

This Dockerfile, like the previous one, uses a multi-stage build. The first stage (`builder`) builds the application using Maven. The second stage sets up a lean runtime environment and copies the built application to it.

To build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t sci-service:latest .
```

To run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 sci-service:latest
```

Make sure you consider setting up environment variables or configurations as required for the application, especially if there are any external connections or service discovery mechanisms you're leveraging.

It's also important to keep in mind that references to "localhost" within your application configuration will need to be adjusted if you're connecting to other services within a Dockerized environment or orchestrator like Kubernetes or Docker Compose.
